				<hr>
				<small> <i>Posted by chris on Thursday</i> </small>
				<p>
					This is my first blog and I am excited to be able to share my thoughts through HTML! ERP systems such as SAP and Oracle are highly complex software I have only just begun to learn. Currently I only have experience using SAP s/3, managing material in the system, transfering raw materials into finished products, and creating sales orders using the Fitter Snacker servers.

				<hr>
				<small><i>Posted by Chris on Friday</i></small>
				<p>
					Business Analysis was a very interesting class, with my created team we contacted a small SAP consulting firm and analysed their business to find areas of improvement. Due to little processes being invlolved in the business, flow charts were minimal and root cause analysis was very quick. The resulted conclusion was for the firm to hire a new employee as the cost of hire was much lower than the than the income the new employee would generate.

				<hr>
				<small><i>Posted by chris on saturday</i></small>
				<p>
					The consulting industry exposes students to a variety of projects that span various industries, creating an optimal environment for maximizing talents and moving a career in the right direction. Having access to so many different situations and being a part of a team to colaboratively create a solution for complex business problems is very interesting and I hope to join a consulting firm for Supply Chain and Network Operations or SAP Enterprise Solutions in the near future.

				<hr>
				<small> <i>Posted by chris on sunday</i> </small>
				<p>
					This is my fourth blog and I am talking about cannabis. Cannabis is a massive industry and will continue to grow in popularity for recreational purposes as well as a replacement to many traditional pharmaceutical medications. The management of the Cannabis supply chain requires proper materials managment from the right storage conditions to using a proper supply calculations to avoid high inventory costs and deterioration of the product. I would llove to be able to manage the supply chain operations of a company such as Canopy Growth and other emerging Canadian businesses!
