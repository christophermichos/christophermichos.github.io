					<p> <u><strong>"Spreadsheet programs</strong></u> are enormously flexible, familiar, and relatively easy to use. As such, they can increase both the breadth and depth of the topics covered in a class. For example, spreadsheets can be set up to numerically solve complex systems of equations, find trends in data, or discover the optimum solution to a problem. However, any class that presents data in a table may use spreadsheet exercises to enhance quantitative literacy. While the efficacy of using spreadsheets to enhance learning has not been formally investigated, the long history of using this technology in a variety of disciplines has revealed undeniable advantages, as documented by Baker and Sugden (2003) in "Spreadsheets in Education –The First 25 Years"."<cite><a style="color: orange" href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/library/spreadsheets/why.html#:~:text=Spreadsheets%20are%20also%20an%20attractive,topics%20covered%20in%20a%20class." target="_blank"> From carleton.edu</a></cite>		 </p>

						I am currently applying my strong critical thinking and organizational skills to my bachelor of commerce degree from Algonquin College. During my first year of studies, I maintained a 3.8 GPA in my economics courses and spreadsheet applications. During the summer, I worked at McDonald's developing my communication and leadership skills while independently studying the marketplace to understand the business environment. As I approach my first work term, I am very interested in utilizing my problem-solving, spreadsheets, and economics strengths within the consulting or financial industry.

						"Object Oriented Language Java has become an attractive and important option for the development of e-business applications, due to its cross-platform capabilities and its rich class libraries. Students are introduced to Java language with an emphasis on language fundamentals. The subject topics include Java language basics and syntax, object-oriented programming, basic GUI programming using Swing, applets, Java I/O classes, and database access. Students are also provided with a brief introduction to an integrated development environment (IDE) and tools for developing Java applications."<cite><a style="color: orange" href= "https://www.algonquincollege.com/business/program/bachelor-of-commerce-e-supply-chain-management/#courses" target="_blank"> From Algonquin College</a></cite>

						"To manage complex business processes in today's global environment, firms need integrated software packages called Enterprise Systems (ES). ES systems include capabilities to support a wide variety of companies and industries. Students concentrate on a theoretical and practical introduction to ERP systems and address the fundamentals needed to integrate data across different business operations. Through labs and exercises, students will configure an ERP for a supply chain scenario and execute procurement, fulfillment and production process transactions in the ERP."<cite><a style="color: orange" href="https://www.algonquincollege.com/business/program/bachelor-of-commerce-e-supply-chain-management/#courses" target="_blank"> From Algonquin College</a></cite>
